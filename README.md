#### Tic Tac Toe

This is a tic tac toe game where the user plays against a computer and the computer chooses a random square based on available squares. 

#### Calculator

A basic calculator, with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions, and it looks just like one those small calculators we all used to have in a drawer in the kitchen.
